# Hello, my name is Sophia Egrari

I just finished my second year at UChicago as a **sociology** major and am interested in possibly completing the data science minor, as well, and am hoping that CFSS will give me a solid introduction to basic programming skills and data visualization!

#### A little bit about me: 
* I am from Seattle, Washington 
* In my free time, I love to draw, play guitar, and read a LOT
* Along with taking CFSS and working as a research assistant, I will also be writing for a blog this summer that advocate for mental health
